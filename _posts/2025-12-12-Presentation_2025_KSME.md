On December 12, 2024, I delivered both an oral presentation and a poster presentation at the Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers (KSME) Annual Conference 2025, held in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province, Republic of Korea.

The oral presentation was titled _“Generative AI-Driven Mixture-of-Experts Framework using Implicit Neural Representations for Additive Manufacturing”_, co-authored with Hansu Kim and Namwoo Kang. This presentation introduced a mixture-of-experts framework that leverages implicit neural representations to address conflicting design requirements in additive manufacturing.

On the same day, I also presented a poster titled _“Manufacturing-Aware 3D Geometry Post-Processing Framework via Depth Maps for 3-Axis CNC Milling”_, co-authored with Jinseong Han, Sanghyeon Kim, Yeseul Cho, and Namwoo Kang. The poster focused on a depth map–based post-processing framework for converting complex 3D geometries into manufacturable designs compatible with 3-axis CNC milling.

It was a valuable opportunity to present and discuss my research through multiple presentation formats at this major mechanical engineering conference.
