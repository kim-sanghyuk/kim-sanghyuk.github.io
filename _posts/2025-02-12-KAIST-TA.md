On February 12, 2025, I had the opportunity to assist in the KAIST Industry-Academia Workshop, "AI-based Design: From Analysis to Design Optimization," held in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. As a teaching assistant, I led a hands-on coding session, helping participants engage with practical exercises. Throughout the workshop, I worked closely with [Prof. Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tYU_Cz0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to ensure smooth delivery and an interactive learning experience.
