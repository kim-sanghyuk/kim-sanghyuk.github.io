On November 8, 2024, I delivered an oral presentation at the Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers (KSME) Annual Meeting 2024, held in Jeju, Republic of Korea. The presentation was titled "3D Spatiotemporal Prediction of Vehicle Collision Dynamics via Implicit Neural Representations." It was a privilege to present my research at this significant event!
