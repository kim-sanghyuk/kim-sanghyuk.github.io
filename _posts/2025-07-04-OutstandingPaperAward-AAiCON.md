I'm honored to share that on July 3â€“4, 2025, I received the **Outstanding Paper Award** at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Conference (AAiCON) held in Daejeon, Korea.  
Our paper, _"Spatio-Temporal Flow Field Prediction of Variable Multi-Cylinder Configurations via DeepONet,"_ was recognized for its contribution to advancing deep learning methods for complex fluid dynamics prediction.

This recognition motivates me to continue pushing the boundaries of AI-driven computational mechanics. Stay tuned for upcoming research updates!
