I am pleased to share that our paper has been accepted for publication in _**Neurocomputing**_.

**Kim S**, Kim H\*, Kang N, Lee TH\* (2025) Projected variable three-term conjugate gradient algorithm for enhancing generalization performance in deep neural network training. [_Neurocomputing_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/neurocomputing), 131568. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.131568](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.131568)

This work proposes the **Projected Variable Three-Term Conjugate Gradient (PVTTCG)** algorithm, which effectively balances fast convergence and improved generalization in deep learning, with validation across image classification, language modeling, and real-world engineering applications.
