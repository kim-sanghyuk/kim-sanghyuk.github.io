I am pleased to share that our paper has been accepted for publication in **Neurocomputing**.

**Kim S**, Kim H, Kang N\*, Lee TH\* (2025) Projected variable three-term conjugate gradient algorithm for enhancing generalization performance in deep neural network training. _Neurocomputing_ _(accepted)_.

This work proposes the **Projected Variable Three-Term Conjugate Gradient (PVTTCG)** algorithm, which effectively balances fast convergence and improved generalization in deep learning, with validation across image classification, language modeling, and real-world engineering applications.
