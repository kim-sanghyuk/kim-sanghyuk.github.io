On April 18, 2025, I delivered an oral presentation at the KSME Conference 2025 (CAE & Applied Mechanics Division), held in Jeju, Republic of Korea.  
The presentation, titled **"Spatio-Temporal Flow Field Prediction of Variable Multi-Cylinder Configurations via DeepONet,"** introduced our latest research on data-driven fluid dynamics modeling.  
It was an honor to share our findings at such a prestigious event.
