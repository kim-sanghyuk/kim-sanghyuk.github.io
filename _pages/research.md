## Optimization Algorithm Research

This study introduces the **Projected Variable Three-Term Conjugate Gradient (PVTTCG)** algorithm, designed to overcome the trade-off between fast convergence and strong generalization in deep neural network training.  
By stabilizing the optimization path through geometric projection, PVTTCG consistently improves generalization performance across benchmarks and real-world applications such as vehicle crash prediction.
